Document: 1. Getting Started

All the files that are required to use BlazeGears can be found in the "Modules" directory. The first file that must be included is "BlazeGears.js", which contains the most essentials functions that will be required by the other classes.

The second file that's supposed to be included is "BlazeGears.BaseClass.js", which is the superclass for all the standard BlazeGears classes. However, if you're not planning to use any of these classes, the BaseClass can be omitted as well.

After this, the rest of the classes can be included as well. Please note that the classes won't automatically include their superclasses or dependencies, since JavaScript doesn't provide a proper way to do this. The superclasses and the dependencies are listed in the documentation.

The style sheet and template files are not required to be included at all. These files are only provided as a reference for customization, their compressed content is already present in the JavaScript files.

The example below will show how to include all the standard classes.

(code)
	<script type="text/javascript" src="BlazeGears/JavaScript/BlazeGears.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		// <![CDATA[
		BlazeGears.includeJs([
